## About Us
My partner, Maximiliano Fairman, and I, Logan T Connors, will be programming every part of our group's robot.
Our Group is called Carl Gustaf, we like to say "We will blow our competitors out of the arena".


## About Maximiliano Fairman
Hey, I’m max, one of the programmers working on the robot for the FTC competition. I’m so far having a lot of fun with this as it’s a great experience. Yet the better experience is working with amazing people to create a working robot. Especially one that YOU programmed, it’s Also the perfect  feeling, to see it work when you spent all that time on it


## About Logan T Connors
My name is Logan T. Connors. I’m a student, and I attend Immaculata High School. In addition to going to school, I am also an infantryman in the Canadian Armed Forces Reserves. I like learning about low-level programming and reverse engineering, as well as playing video games and coding games and programs. Additionally, I love to listen to music, more specifically classic rock and heavy metal. In my free time, I often find myself listening to my favourite music while playing games or programming. It can be difficult to balance my hobbies, military training, and school, but it feeds my love of technology and innovative thinking.


## Why We Are Building A Robot
We are building a Robot for this year's FTC 2025-2026 Decode Challenge.
